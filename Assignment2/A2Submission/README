Note: When the program terminates by "!", there would be some error gracefully reported but they are expected for our program design.

The errors are:
  > local s-talk session:
    - Scr_out: Trimming message from receiver list FAILED.
  > remote s-talk session:
    - UDP_Tx: Trimming message from transmitter list FAILED.
    - Scr_out: Trimming message from receiver list FAILED.

This is because we are manually signalling the lists to trim NULL items in order to trigger shutdown for the threads.
